Q Write a program to find and print IP addresses of one or more URLs passed as an argument through command line.
Also report the values of all the elements of structure addrinfo returned by getaddrinfo() function. 
Write their significance. You have to also report the number of outputs generated by getaddrinfo() for each URL entered by you.
Write their significance as well.

Q Write a program to find and print IP addresses of one or more URLs passed as an argument through command line. You are also provided the source code of getaddrinfo() function. (https://code.woboq.org/userspace/glibc/sysdeps/posix/getaddrinfo.c.html) Take some time to go through the code, in particular those lines that are relevant for this assignment.

You have to make the following modifications in the program "showip.c" given in beej guide for socket programming. 
1. Delete the lines 
"memset(&hints, 0, sizeof hints);
hints.ai_family = AF_UNSPEC; // AF_INET or AF_INET6 to force version
hints.ai_socktype = SOCK_STREAM;"
How and why does it impact your program? Can you get rid of using memset function in the program and still achieve the same functionality?

2. Report the values of all the elements of structure addrinfo returned by getaddrinfo() function. Write their significance. How is each element different from the default values provided in the source code for getaddrinfo().

3. Also report the number of outputs generated by getaddrinfo() for each URL entered by you. Write their significance as well. How much space (in bytes) is each output by getaddrinfo taking?

4. When printing more than one URLs, also print all the IP addresses reported before. You have to do this by appending to the linked list the output of each getaddrinfo, i.e., you have to make a linked list that is aggregate of all the linked lists reported by getaddrinfo for all the URLs.
