lspci- prints ("lists") detailed information about all PCI buses and devices in the system
ethtool - query or control network driver and hardware settings 
ARP- protocol for mapping an Internet Protocol address (IP address) to a physical machine address that is recognized in the local network
ip-link - network device configuration 
ifconfig is used to configure, or view the configuration of, a network interface.
ip-neighbour - neighbour/arp tables management.
ip route - used to configure the static route
route- sed to view and manipulate the IP routing table 
netstat- print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships 
lsof- "list open files", which is used in many Unix-like systems to report a list of all open files and the processes that opened them.

Task 1: Physical and Data link layer

	1.Find out what network cards your machine has. What is the speed?(lspci)
	lspci					enp3s0
	ethtool enp3s0				Speed: 1000Mb/s

	2.What is the current speed of the network interface? What offload features are enabled?(ethtool)
	ethtool enp3s0				Speed: 1000Mb/s
	ethtool -k enp3s0			
	On features- rx-checksumming, generic-receive-offload, rx-vlan-offload, tx-vlan-offload, highdma

	3.What is the MAC address of your machine?(ip link, arp)
	link/ether 34:64:a9:1f:7f:be
	HWaddress 70:01:b5:99:e9:67

	4.How many bytes did your eth0/em1 interface receive since boot?(ifconfig)
	RX packets 86786  bytes 104646109 (104.6 MB)

	5.What is the MTU setting for eth0/em1?(ip link, ifconfig)
	mtu 1500 bytes

Task 2: Network Layer

	1.What is your machine’s network address? What is the default gateway (IP address and MAC address) of your network?(ip route, route, ip neighbour)  
	arp		MAC address of switch		lladdr 70:01:b5:99:e9:67
	ifconfig	machine’s network address	34:64:a9:1f:7f:be
	ifconfig	IP address			IPV4- 172.22.12.185	IPV6- fe80::91ff:95d2:bc83:e0b8

	2.Show the arp entries in your machine.(arp, ip neighbour)
	Address                  HWtype  HWaddress           Flags Mask            Iface
	_gateway                 ether   70:01:b5:99:e9:67   C                     enp3s0
	ip neighbour		172.22.12.1 dev enp3s0 lladdr 70:01:b5:99:e9:67 REACHABLE

	3.Perform a traceroute/mtr to any web address. Provide the full traceroute/mtr output. Show how mtr and traceroute is working by packet capturing tools.(mtr, traceroute, tcpdump host)
	Command running till localhost bz blocked due to security tracing issues

	4.How many IP packets has received by your machine after current boot process?  (netstat)
	netstat -s	51325 total packets received

Task 3: Transport layer

	1.Find the active TCP connection on your machine? (netstat)
	 netstat -nap			tcp- 14		38		602 active connection openings

	2.How many sockets are currently open on your machine?(netstat)
	udp+tcp= 45
	udp = 602 active connection openings
	tcp = 602 active connection openings
	 ss -s
	Total: 1692 (kernel 0)
	TCP:   62 (estab 45, closed 12, orphaned 2, synrecv 0, timewait 12/0), ports 0

	Transport Total     IP        IPv6
	*	  0         -         -        
	RAW	  1         0         1        
	UDP	  7         5         2        
	TCP	  50        49        1        
	INET	  58        54        4        
	FRAG	  0         0         0      

	3.How many applications on your machine accessing network services? Also identify their access protocol.(lsof)
	netstat -an |grep :80 |wc –l
	netstat -ant | grep LISTEN
	tcp        0      0 127.0.0.53:53           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
	tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:631           0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN     
	tcp6       0      0 ::1:631                 :::*                    LISTEN
